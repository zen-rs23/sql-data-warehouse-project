# **Naming Conventions**

To maintain consistency, readability, and scalability across the Data Warehouse, the following naming conventions were strictly followed:

## 1. General Principles

- Case Style: All objects use snake_case (lowercase with underscores) (`_`) to separate words.
- Language: All names are in English.
- Reserved Words: Standard SQL reserved words are avoided for object names.

## 2. Table & Schema Naming
- The warehouse is organized into three schemas: bronze, silver, and gold.
- Bronze & Silver Layers: Tables follow the pattern <source_system>_<original_entity_name>.
- Examples: crm_cust_info, erp_loc_a101, crm_sales_details.
- Gold Layer: Tables/Views use business-aligned names with category prefixes:
- dim_ for Dimensions (e.g., gold.dim_customers, gold.dim_products).
- fact_ for Fact tables (e.g., gold.fact_sales).

## 3. Column Naming Standards
- Surrogate Keys: Primary keys in the Gold layer use the suffix _key to distinguish them from source system IDs.
- Example: customer_key, product_key.
- Technical Columns: Metadata columns generated by the DWH use the dwh_ prefix.
- Example: dwh_create_date (tracks when a record was loaded into the warehouse).

## 4. Stored Procedures
- All ETL orchestration logic follows the load_<layer> pattern:
- bronze.load_bronze: Handles ingestion from CSVs to the Bronze layer.
- silver.load_silver: Handles cleansing and transformation to the Silver layer.
