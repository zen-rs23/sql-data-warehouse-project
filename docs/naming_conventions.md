# **Naming Conventions**

To maintain consistency, readability, and scalability across the Data Warehouse, the following naming conventions were strictly followed:

## 1. General Principles

- Case Style: All objects use snake_case (lowercase with underscores) (`_`) to separate words.
- Language: All names are in English.
- Reserved Words: Standard SQL reserved words are avoided for object names.

## 2. Table & Schema Naming
### **Bronze Rules**
- All names must start with the source system name, and table names must match their original names without renaming.
- **`<sourcesystem>_<entity>`**  
  - `<sourcesystem>`: Name of the source system (e.g., `crm`, `erp`).  
  - `<entity>`: Exact table name from the source system.  
  - Example: `crm_customer_info` → Customer information from the CRM system.

### **Silver Rules**
- All names must start with the source system name, and table names must match their original names without renaming.
- **`<sourcesystem>_<entity>`**  
  - `<sourcesystem>`: Name of the source system (e.g., `crm`, `erp`).  
  - `<entity>`: Exact table name from the source system.  
  - Example: `crm_customer_info` → Customer information from the CRM system.

### **Gold Rules**
- All names must use meaningful, business-aligned names for tables, starting with the category prefix.
- **`<category>_<entity>`**  
  - `<category>`: Describes the role of the table, such as `dim` (dimension) or `fact` (fact table).  
  - `<entity>`: Descriptive name of the table, aligned with the business domain (e.g., `customers`, `products`, `sales`).  
  - Examples:
    - `dim_customers` → Dimension table for customer data.  
    - `fact_sales` → Fact table containing sales transactions.  


## 3. Column Naming Standards
- Surrogate Keys: Primary keys in the Gold layer use the suffix _key to distinguish them from source system IDs.
- Example: customer_key, product_key.
- Technical Columns: Metadata columns generated by the DWH use the dwh_ prefix.
- Example: dwh_create_date (tracks when a record was loaded into the warehouse).

## 4. Stored Procedures
- All ETL orchestration logic follows the load_<layer> pattern:
- bronze.load_bronze: Handles ingestion from CSVs to the Bronze layer.
- silver.load_silver: Handles cleansing and transformation to the Silver layer.
